This is the script with which Yegappan Lakshmanan generated the Vim FAQ in Vim Help format. 

If you're just interested in the Vim FAQ in Vim Help format you might as well get it here: http://www.geocities.com/yegappan/vim_faq_help.txt . But if you'd like to help (Yegappan and) me improve this script (or just have a look at this script out of curiosity) you might want to download this script.

There's no documentation. The script should have enough comments to explain itself.
